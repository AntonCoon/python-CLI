1 This document gives coding conventions for the Python code comprising the standard
2 library in the main Python distribution. Please see the companion informational PEP
3 describing style guidelines for the C code in the C implementation of Python.
4 This document and PEP 257 (Docstring Conventions) were adapted from Guido's original
5 Python Style Guide essay, with some additions from Barry's style guide.
6 This style guide evolves over time as additional conventions are identified and past
7 conventions are rendered obsolete by changes in the language itself.
